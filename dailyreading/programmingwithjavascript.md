```
MVC - Minimum Viable Code - remember not to over do it!
Leave comment in code for myself!
“ command / “  
also make a todo list, todo tree  // TODO: “add something”
paste the reqs right in the code so you know what to do THEN work on the fun stuff!

# Programming with JavaScript

we learned conditionals yesterday

## today is **functions**

Write out things 5 times on paper and 5 times on the computer!!

### 4 foundational pieces for JS
- function 
- loops
arrays
conditionals

# Programming 

How is programming like baking a cake.
	- the right ingredients
	- in the right orders

Coding is telling the computer what you want it to do, only what you tell it to do!

## How to tell a Robot how to put on a sweater that has a hood to put on and a zipper that is already zipped up.
- pick up the sweater
- hold sweater with one hand
- grab pull tab of the zipper
- pull the pull tab of the zipper down until it unhooks
- hold the sweater in a way where the hood is topside
- adjust the sweater so that it is open to your back from the inside 
- move the sweater so that the left arm can slide into the left sleeve 
- insert left arm into left sleeve 
- move right shoulder to adjust so that the right arm can slip into right sleeve
- insert right arm into right sleeve 
- adjust sweater to close in the front 
- grab zipper and connect to the other zipper part on the other side
- pull up on the zipper while pulling down the bottom of the sweat with other hand
- pull all the way up to the top of the sweater
- reach back to behind the head
- grab the hood
- pull the hood up and over to fit on head
**this is how easy it is to break code!**

Reference
Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery:
Intro + Scripts: Pages 1 - 24
Expressions + Operators: 74 - 79
Functions: 88 - 94. (focus on this the most!!!)


### Vocab
- Script
- JavaScript's vocabulary
- JavaScript's syntax
- Programmatic problem solving
- Expression
- Operator
- Function - functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). *Furthermore the statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads, so functions also offer a way to  **store** the steps needed to achieve a task.* ***for example, you might have a task that you only want to perform iff the user clicks on a specific element in the page.***
- - Declaration
- - Call - the call () allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object. **call** () provides a new value of this to the function/method. With **call** (), you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object. *naming a function to perform a task so you make call on it later* 
- - Parameters - some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task. *for example, a function to calculate the area of a box would need to know its width and height. **Pieces of information passed to a function are known as parameters.**
- - Arguments
- - Return value - When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with can answer, the response is known as a **return value**.
Refactoring

### To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
### This is known as a **function declaration**
- You declare a **function** using the **function** keyword.
You give the function a **name** (sometimes called an **identifier**) followed by parenthesis. 
- The **statement** that perform the task sit in a code block. (They are inside curly braces.)

```
function say Hello() {
	document.write(‘Hello!’);
}
```
