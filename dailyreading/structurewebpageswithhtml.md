### **Structure** *(chapter 1)*

The building of your skeleton!
* HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets - these are called HTML **elements.** 
* Elements are usually made up of two **tags:** an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has a backslash at the beginning of it.)
* Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
* Tags act like containers!
